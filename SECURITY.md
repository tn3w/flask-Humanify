# flask_Captchaify Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Information
### Introduction
I welcome feedback from security researchers and the general public to help improve the security of this project.
If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, privacy issue, exposed data, or other security issues related to this project, I want to hear from you.
This policy outlines the steps for reporting vulnerabilities to me, what I need and how I will respond.

### Systems in Scope
This policy applies to all files, libraries or requirements that this project requires.
I can only fix bugs in the latest version, as anything else would be too much effort.

### My Commitments
If you work with me, you can expect me to do the following in accordance with this policy:
- Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and validate your report;
- Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is processed;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner, within my operational constraints; and
- Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy.

### My Expectations
In participating in my vulnerability disclosure program in good faith, I ask that you:
- Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other applicable terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting other systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with me;
- Provide me a reasonable amount of time (at least 45 days from the initial report) to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information;
- You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.

### Official Channels
Please report security problems via [mail@tn3w.dev](mailto:mail@tn3w.dev) or at [https://github.com/tn3w/flask_Captchaify/security](https://github.com/tn3w/flask_Captchaify/security) and provide all relevant information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for me to isolate and resolve the problem.

### Safe Harbor
When carrying out vulnerability research in accordance with this policy, you should only carry out tests on your own resources. I cannot guarantee that individuals or companies using this software will not take legal action against you if you test it on them.
If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of the Official Channels before going any further.

I commit to:
- Not pursue legal action against you.
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
- Recognize your contribution in our security advisories, if you wish.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
1. Report to one of my official channels.
2. Include the following information in your report:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
   - Your contact information for follow-up (optional but helpful).
3. If you prefer, you can use my PGP key to encrypt your report. The PGP key can be found [here](https://www.tn3w.dev/publ-key.asc) or use fingerprint 0C57B74B2C3B2F026984617129B39032102303D7 to request it.
